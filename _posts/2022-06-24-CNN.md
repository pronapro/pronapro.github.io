Convolutional Neural Networks and Popular CNN architectures
===========================================================

Convolutional neural network(CNN) is a type of artificial neural network mostly used for computer vision tasks, it has an input layer, hidden layer and output layers. The network can have many hidden layers. The structure of CNN was inspired by the virtual context of the brain.

The most important operation in a CNN is the convolution operation because of its ability to extract important features. A CNN typically has two parts, the feature extraction part and the image classification part. The main drawback of CNNs is that it  requires a lot of training data and computational resources.

Convolution operation
---------------------

Convolution is a mathematical operation to merge two sets of information.

A kernel is moved across the input matrix to output a feature map. The output feature map is obtained by a matrix multiplication and summation of the results.

In the figure below, the pixels in pink are multiplied with a 3x3 filter and the results are summed to give a 3 in the feature map. We are using a stride of 1. A stride determines the size of steps taken by a convolutional filter. Since we are using a stride of one the filter strides pixel by pixel.

Layers in a Convolutional Neural Network
----------------------------------------

1.  Convolution and ReLu(activation function) layer

  Filters in the convolution layer perform the convolution operation. Filters detect pattern like the edges, corners, squares etc
  Relu activation function introduces  non linearity and also speeds up training. It sets negative values to zero.

2.  Pooling layer

 Pooling layer downsamples the feature maps. This reduces the dimensionality of the feature map and computation. It also helps to reduce overfitting.
 Even though the pooling operation reduces the input size, it still preserves the salient features that the network has to learn.

Pooling operation

Pooling can be then in three ways, average pooling, max pooling and min pooling. The most commonly used methods are  max pooling where the maximum value in a given patch is considered and min pooling where the minimum value in a given patch is considered.  The pooling filter should be less than the feature map. In the diagram below we use 2X2 filter, a stride of two and max pooling to reduce the feature map by a factor of 2.

3. Fully connected(dense) layer

        After the feature extraction, flattening is performed to convert the pooled feature maps to a linear vector which is fed into the fully connected layer.

The fully connected layer outputs confidence scores which are used to determine which class the image belongs to. It does the classification in the output layer.

CNNs have many layers and filters. The first layer usually extracts the basic features like edges, this is then passed to next layers which detect more complex features. This feature detection continues as the network gets deeper and in the end it is able to detect the complex features.

Sample CNN architectures
------------------------

Availability of labeled data and computational resources has led to popularity of CNNs leading to many architecture innovations and improvements in the performance of the CNN.

### AlexNet

It has eight layers and 3 layers are fully connected layers.  AlexNet has  ReLu activation functions, a max-pooling layer and a dropout layer to prevent overfitting.

### GoogleNet

Has 22 layers

GoogleNet is made of subnets called inception to help cover a larger area and also handle objects at different scales.

### VGG

VGG introduces several 3x3 kernel-sized filters that are next to each other.  The number represents the number of weight layers on each variant e.g vgg16 has 16 layers.

The VGG-16 consists of 13 convolutional layers and three fully connected layers

### ResNet

resNet introduced skip connections which help to introduce rich feature maps from lower levels.

Tasks where CNNs excel
----------------------

CNNs perform best in computer vision tasks like:

1. Image processing

2. Video analysis

3. Facial recognition

4. Because of their ability to do feature extraction, The different architectures are modified to  carry out different tasks. for example, with segmentation tasks the fully connected layers are replaced with upsampling layers.
